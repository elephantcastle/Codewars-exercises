Find the difference between two collections. The difference means that either the character is present in one collection or it is present in other, but not in both. Return a sorted list with the difference.

The collections can contain any character and can contain duplicates.

## Example

```
A = [a, a, t, e, f, i, j]

B = [t, g, g, i, k, f]

difference = [a, e, g, j, k]
```
