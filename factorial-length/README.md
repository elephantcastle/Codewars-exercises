 - Description:
In this Kata, you will implement a function `count` that takes an integer and returns the number of digits in `factorial(n)`. 

For example, `count(5) = 3`, because `5! = 120`, and `120` has `3` digits.  

More examples in the test cases. 

Brute force is not possible. A little research will go a long way, as this is a well known series.

Good luck!
