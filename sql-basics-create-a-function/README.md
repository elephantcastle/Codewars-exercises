 - Description:
For this challenge you need to create a basic Increment function which Increments on the age field of the peoples table.

The function should be called `increment`, it needs to take 1 integer and increment that number by 1.

You may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain the function on your final submit.

## important: you must remove all comments when submitting the kata.

### people table schema
- id
- name
- age  

> NOTE: Your solution should use PL/SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
