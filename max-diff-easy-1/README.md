 - Description:
You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given `list / array` (`lst`) received as the parameter.

* `lst` contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers
* if `lst` is empty or contains a single element, return `0`
* `lst` is not sorted

```c
[1, 2, 3, 4]   //  returns 3 because 4 -   1  == 3
[1, 2, 3, -4]  //  returns 7 because 3 - (-4) == 7
```

Have fun!
