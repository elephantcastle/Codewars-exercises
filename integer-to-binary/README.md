 - Description:
Convert an integer number into binary 1's and 0's string!
Dealing only with positive integers, the input number should
be able to be converted to a binary string **with a leading zero**!

In binary, the left-most digit represents the sign of the binary number:
`0` for positive, `1` for negative (using 2's complement, but that's another story)

For this test example we will only be using positive integers for simplicity:

```python
int_2_bin(0) ==> '0'
int_2_bin(1) ==> '01'
int_2_bin(5) ==> '0101'
```
