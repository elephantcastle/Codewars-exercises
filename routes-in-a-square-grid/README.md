 - Description:
Given a side length `n`, traveling only right and down how many ways are there to get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of an `n by n` grid?

Your mission is to write a program to do just that!

Add code to `route(n)` that returns the number of routes for a grid `n by n` (if n is less than 1 return 0).

Examples:
    
    -100 -> 0
    
    1 -> 2
     
    2 -> 6
     
    20 -> 137846528820
    
Note: 
you're traveling on the edges of the squares in the grid not the squares themselves.
