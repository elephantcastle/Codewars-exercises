 - Description:
An integer partition of `n` is a weakly decreasing list of positive integers which sum to `n`.

For example, there are 7 integer partitions of 5:
```python
[5], [4,1], [3,2], [3,1,1], [2,2,1], [2,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1].
```
Write a function which returns the number of integer partitions of `n`.  The function should be able to find the number of integer partitions of `n` for `n` at least as large as 100.
