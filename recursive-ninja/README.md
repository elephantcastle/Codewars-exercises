 - Description:
Ninjas frequently need to signal each other in code, often employing natural sounds as a cover. Weâ€™re going to give our ninja the ability to chirp like a cricket, with the number of chirps encoding different messages.

Implement a "recursive function" that takes one parameter (n) and outputs a string i.e.

``` javascript
  chirp(4);
  //output would be chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.
```

javascript/coffescript: don't use the String method .repeat(), write a recursive function, remember you're a Ninja!
