 - Description:
Construct a function 'coordinates', that will return the distance between two points on a cartesian plane, given the x and y coordinates of each point.

There are two parameters in the function, ```p1``` and ```p2```. ```p1``` is a list ```[x1,y1]``` where ```x1``` and ```y1``` are the x and y coordinates of the first point. ```p2``` is a list ```[x2,y2]``` where ```x2``` and ```y2``` are the x and y coordinates of the second point. 

The distance between the two points should be rounded to the `precision` decimal if provided, otherwise to the nearest integer.
