 - Description:
A "Perfect Number" is a number in which the sum of its factors (excluding itself) are equal to itself. 

Write a function that can verify if the given integer is a perfect number.


## Example

`28` has the following factors: `1, 2, 4, 7, 14`

`1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28` therefore `28` is a perfect number!
