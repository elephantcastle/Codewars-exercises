 - Description:
Write a function `get_char()` / `getChar()` which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.

```if:c
In C, `getchar()` is an important built-in function, so the function will be named `char_of_code` to avoid confusion.
```

Example: 

```javascript
get_char(65)
```

should return:

```javascript
'A'
```
