 - Description:
You get a "text" and have to shift the vowels by "n" positions to the right.<br/>
(Negative value for n should shift to the left.)<br/>
"Position" means the vowel's position if taken as one item in a list of all vowels within the string.<br>
A shift by 1 would mean, that every vowel shifts to the place of the next vowel.<br><br>
Shifting over the edges of the text should continue at the other edge.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
text = "This is a test!"<br/>
n = 1<br/>
output = "Thes is i tast!"<br/>
<br/>
text = "This is a test!"<br/>
n = 3<br/>
output = "This as e tist!"<br/>
<br/>
If text is null or empty return exactly this value.<br>
Vowels are "a,e,i,o,u".

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)<br>

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.
