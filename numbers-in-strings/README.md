 - Description:
In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. Your task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number. Numbers will not have leading zeros. 

For example, `solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695`, because this is the largest of all number groupings. 

Good luck!
