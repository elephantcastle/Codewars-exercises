<h3>TODO</h3>
<p>Multiply two numbers! Simple!</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>The arguments are passed as strings.
<li>The numbers will be very large
<li>The arguments can be negative, in decimals, and might have leading and trailing zeros. e.g. <code>"-01.300"</code>
<li>Answer should be returned as string
<li>The returned answer should not have leading or trailing zeroes (when applicable) e.g. <code>"0123"</code> and <code>"1.100"</code> are wrong, they should be <code>"123"</code> and <code>"1.1"</code>
<li>Zero should not be signed and <code>"-0.0"</code> should be simply returned as <code>"0"</code>. 
</ol>
