 - Description:
In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function. 

Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not). 

The function needs to return either a true or false. 

Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.
