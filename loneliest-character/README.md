 - Description:
Complete the function  which accepts a string and return an array of character(s) that have the most spaces to their right and left.


**Notes:**

* the string can have leading/trailing spaces - you **should not** count them
* the strings contain only unique characters from `a` to `z`
* the order of characters in the returned array doesn"t matter

## Examples

```javascript
"a b  c"                        -->  ["b"]
"a bcs           d k"           -->  ["d"]
"    a b  sc     p     t   k"   -->  ["p"]
"a  b  c  de"                   -->  ["b", "c"]
"     a  b  c de        "       -->  ["b"]
"abc"                           -->  ["a", "b", "c"]
```

Good luck!
