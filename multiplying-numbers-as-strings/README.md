Multiply two numbers! Simple!

1. The arguments are passed as strings.
2. The numbers may be way very large
3. Answer should be returned as a string
4. The returned "number" should not start with zeros e.g. 0123 is invalid

Note: 100 randomly generated tests!

### Important
Usage of `num::BigInt` is disallowed and will be checked in the full test suite.
