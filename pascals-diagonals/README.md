 - Description:
Create a function that returns an array containing the first `l` numbers from the `n`th diagonal of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle).

`n = 0` should generate the first diagonal of the triangle (the ones).  
The first number in each diagonal should be `1`.  
If `l = 0`, return an empty array.  
Both `n` and `l` will be non-negative integers in all test cases.
