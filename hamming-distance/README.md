 - Description:
The [Hamming Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match. 

Examples (in JavaScript):

```
hamming("I like turtles","I like turkeys")  //returns 3
hamming("Hello World","Hello World")  //returns 0
```

You can assume that the two input strings are of equal length.
