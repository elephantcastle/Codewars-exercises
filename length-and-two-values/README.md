 - Description:
Given an integer `n` and two other values, build an array of size `n` filled with these two values alternating.


## Examples
```ruby
5, true, false     -->  [true, false, true, false, true]
10, "blue", "red"  -->  ["blue", "red", "blue", "red", "blue", "red", "blue", "red", "blue", "red"]
0, "one", "two"    -->  []
```

Good luck!
