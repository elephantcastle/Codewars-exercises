 - Description:
Here at Conformity Inc. we only like even things. We need you to put a stop to anything that does not conform to our strict even only policy.

Write a function that will convert any number to its nearest even number.  When the number is halfway between two even numbers it should round away from zero.

Examples

```1    => 2```

```0.5  => 0```

```-1   => -2```

```-0.5  => 0```
