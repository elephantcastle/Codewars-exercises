 - Description:
A genetic algorithm is based in groups of chromosomes, called populations. To start our population of chromosomes we need to generate random binary strings with a specified length.

In this kata you have to implement a function `generate` that receives a `length` and has to return a random binary strign with `length` characters.

# Example:

Generate a chromosome with length of 4 `generate(4)` could return the chromosome `0010`, `1110`, `1111`... or any of `2^4` possibilities.

***Note:*** *Some tests are random. If you think your algorithm is correct but the result fails, trying again should work.*
