## Ordering food

You are in charge of ordering food for a party. You are going to need 4 sandwiches, 6 salads, 5 wraps, and 10 orders of french fries. The cost per item of food is:

food | price
---|---
sandwich | $8.00
salad | $7.00
wrap | $6.50
french fries | $1.20

---

Create 4 variables to store the quantity of each type of food with the following names:

- `sandwiches`
- `salads`
- `wraps`
- `frenchFries`

Create a variable named `totalPrice` that finds the cost of all of the food.
