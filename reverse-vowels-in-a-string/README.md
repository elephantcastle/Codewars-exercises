 - Description:
In this kata, your goal is to write a function which will reverse the vowels in a string. Any characters which are not vowels should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:

```javascript
reverseVowels("Hello!"); // "Holle!"
reverseVowels("Tomatoes"); // "Temotaos"
reverseVowels("Reverse Vowels In A String") // "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
```

For simplicity, you can treat the letter y as a consonant, not a vowel.

Good luck!
