 - Description:
This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

`Point` objects have `x`, `y`,  and `z` attributes. For Haskell there are `Point` data types described with record syntax with fields `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Write a function calculating distance between `Point a` and `Point b`.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places. Tests in Haskell will not round.
