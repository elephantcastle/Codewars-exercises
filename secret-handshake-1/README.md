 - Description:
There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

1 = wink 

10 = double blink

100 = close your eyes

1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 3, the function would return the array ["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.

Given the input 19, the function would return the array ["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary. 

Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary) has caused the array to be reversed.

IMPORTANT
The inputs of the handshake function is a binary or a number and returns a list.
The code function return a binary number from a list.
Please refers to the example tests for data validation and enjoy.
