 - Description:
You have to search all numbers from inclusive 1 to inclusive a given number x, that have the given digit d in it.<br>
The value of d will always be 0 - 9.<br>
The value of x will always be greater than 0.

You have to return as an array<br>
 - the count of these numbers,<br>
 - their sum <br>
 - and their product.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>

```
x = 11
d = 1
->
Numbers: 1, 10, 11
Return: [3, 22, 110]
```
<br>
If there are no numbers, which include the digit, return [0,0,0].
