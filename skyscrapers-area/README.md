 - Description:
We want to find the area of a set of buildings stacked close to each other.

A matrix A(an array of arrays) gives us a description of the building from above, where each number represents the height expressed in cubes 1\*1\*1, the cubes are stacked adjacent to each other.

For example [[2,1],[2,0]]: so in position (0,0) there are 2 cubes staked on each other, so in position (0,1) 1 cube, so in position (1,0) there are 2 cubes staked on each other, so in position (1,1) there are 0 cubes staked on each other.

In this example, the area is 20.

The matrix will be of at least size 1\*1 and square.

The floor of the building counts as area as well.
