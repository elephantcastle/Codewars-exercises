 - Description:
Your users' passwords were all stolen in the Yahoo! hack, and it turns out they have been lax in creating secure passwords. Create a function that checks their new password (passed as a string) to make sure it meets the following requirements:

* Between 8 - 20 characters
* Contains **only** the following characters (and at least one character from each category):
 * uppercase letters,
 * lowercase letters,
 * digits,
 * special characters from `!@#$%^&*?`

Return `"valid"` if passed or `"not valid"` otherwise.
