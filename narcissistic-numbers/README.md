 - Description:
A Narcissistic Number is a number of length `l` in which the sum of its digits to the power of `l` is equal to the original number. If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

Ex: `153`, where `l = 3` ( the number of digits in `153` )  
1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 153

Write a function that, given `n`, returns whether or not `n` is a Narcissistic Number.
