 - Description:
You've just finished writing the last chapter for your novel when a virus suddenly infects your document. It has swapped the 'i's and 'e's in 'ei' words and  capitalised random letters. Write a function which will:

a) remove the spelling errors in 'ei' words. (Example of 'ei' words: their, caffeine, deceive, weight)

b) only capitalise the first letter of each sentence. Make sure the rest of the sentence is in lower case. 


Example: 
He haD iEght ShOTs of CAffIEne. --> He had eight shots of caffeine.
