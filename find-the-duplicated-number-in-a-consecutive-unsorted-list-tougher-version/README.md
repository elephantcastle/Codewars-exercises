Spin-off of <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/558dd9a1b3f79dc88e000001" target="_blank" title="Duplicated Number in a Consecutive Unsorted List">this kata</a>, here you will have to figure out an efficient strategy to solve the problem of finding the sole duplicate number among an unsorted array/list of numbers starting from 1 up to n.

Hints: a solution in linear time can be found; using the most intuitive ones to search for duplicates that can run in O(nÂ²) time won't work.
