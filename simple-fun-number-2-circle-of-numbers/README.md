# Task
Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighbouring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighbouring, too).

 Given `n` and `firstNumber`/`first_number`/`first-number`, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

# Example

 For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be 7

   A positive even integer.

   Constraints: 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000.

 - `[input]` integer `firstNumber`/`first_number`/`first-number`

   Constraints: 0 ≤ firstNumber ≤ n - 1

 - `[output]` an integer
