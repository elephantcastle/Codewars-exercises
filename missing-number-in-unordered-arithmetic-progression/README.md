 - Description:
If you have not ever heard the term **Arithmetic Progression**, refer to: 
http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-missing-term-in-an-arithmetic-progression/python

And here is an unordered version. Try if you can survive lists of **MASSIVE** numbers (which means time limit should be considered). :D

Note: Don't be afraid that the minimum or the maximum element in the list is missing, e.g. [4, 6, 3, 5, 2] is missing 1 or 7, but this case is excluded from the kata.

Example:

```python
find([3, 9, 1, 11, 13, 5]) # => 7
```
