Python is now supported on Codewars!

For those of us who are not very familiar with Python, let's handle the very basic challenge of creating a class named `Python`. We want to give our Pythons a name, so it should take a name argument that we can retrieve later. 

For example:

```python
bubba = Python('Bubba')
bubba.name # should return 'Bubba'
```
