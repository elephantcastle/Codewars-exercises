 - Description:
Given some positive integers, I wish to print the integers such that all take up the same width by adding a minimum number of leading zeroes. No leading zeroes shall be added to the largest integer.

For example, given `1, 23, 2, 17, 102`, I wish to print out these numbers as follows:

```
001
023
002
017
102
```

Write a function that takes a variable number of integers and returns the string to be printed out.
