# Mirror - <span style="display: inline-block; transform: scale(-1, 1)">Mirror</span>

Can you mirror the properties on an object?

Given an object with properties with no value

```
abc: -
arara: -
xyz: -
```

Return a new object that have the properties with its mirrored key!

```
abc: cba
arara: arara
xyz: zyx
```

"You cannot change the original object, because if you did that the reflection would change."
